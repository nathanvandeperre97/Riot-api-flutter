# riot_api_flutter

- A new Flutter project.
- This project is made to test the riot api within a flutter application.

## Getting Started

- The released apk will use a private apiKey.
- In order to use the app, you'll need to add an apiKey in a file named config.json in the folder assets/config/ .
- This will look like this :
```sh
{
    "api_key": "[Put the key here]"
}
```
